# Game Background:
- Guo's Underground Fight Club (GUFC) is a game demo made by Seablaze Studio. 
- It is seperated from our other game "Bullets & Rights"(B&R), which is a much larger story-telling game based on top-down shooting and puzzle solving. GUFC, with minor modification, serve as the top-down shooting mechanism in B&R.
- The current version is still a very early version of prototype, thus it's solo created by Eric and all the art and music assets are still in developing process.

# Game Play:
- Players use the similar to classic mobile shooting game contol, one set of "up-down-lef-right" to move and another set to shoot. At this verson, only the "1 vs 1 duel" mode is available, where two players fight against each other for the victory. But Solo and Double misson mode will be added shortly in the futre. 
- Players choose of the the four distinctive characters with perspective strength and short-coming, and battle to win. There are camps on the battle field which remains neutral until destoryed, aka conqured, by a player. Then the camp would fight in favor of that player and would shoot if it's opponent is within the shooting range. Players can win by directly killing the other player, or by destroying the home base of the other player, or by conquering all the neutral camps.
